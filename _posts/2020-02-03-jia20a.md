title: " Normalizing Constant Estimation with Gaussianized Bridge Sampling"
abstract: " Normalizing constant (also called partition function, Bayesian evidence,
  or marginal likelihood) is one of the central goals of Bayesian inference, yet most
  of the existing methods are both expensive and inaccurate. Here we develop a new
  approach, starting from posterior samples obtained with a standard Markov Chain
  Monte Carlo (MCMC). We apply a novel Normalizing Flow (NF) approach to obtain an
  analytic density estimator from these samples, followed by Optimal Bridge Sampling
  (OBS) to obtain the normalizing constant. We compare our method which we call Gaussianized
  Bridge Sampling (GBS) to existing methods such as Nested Sampling (NS) and Annealed
  Importance Sampling (AIS) on several examples, showing our method is both signicantly
  faster and substantially more accurate than these methods, and comes with a reliable
  error estimation."
