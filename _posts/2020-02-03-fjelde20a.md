title: " Bijectors.jl:\r Flexible transformations for probability distributions"
abstract: 'Transforming one probability distribution to another is a powerful tool
  in Bayesian inference and machine learning. Some prominent examples are constrained-to-unconstrained
  transformations of distributions for use in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and constructing
  exible and learnable densities such as normalizing ows. We present Bijectors.jl,
  a software package in Julia for transforming distributions, available at github.com/TuringLang/Bijectors.jl.
  The package provides a exible and composable way of implementing transformations
  of distributions without being tied to a computational framework. We demonstrate
  the use of Bijectors.jl on improving variational inference by encoding known statistical
  dependencies into the variational posterior using normalizing ows, providing a general
  approach to relaxing the mean-field assumption usually made in variational inference. '
