title: " Variational Predictive Information Bottleneck"
abstract: " In classic papers, Zellner (1988, 2002) demonstrated that ayesian inference
  could be derived as the solution to an information theoretic functional. Below we
  derive a generalized form of this functional as a variational lower bound of a predictive
  information bottleneck objective. This generalized functional encompasses most modern
  inference procedures and suggests novel ones."
