title: Variational Selective Autoencoder
abstract: " Despite promising progress on unimodal data imputation (e.g. image inpainting),
  models for multimodal data imputation are far from satisfactory. In this work, we
  propose variational selective autoencoder (VSAE) for this task. Learning only from
  partially-observed data, VSAE can model the joint distribution of observed/unobserved
  modalities and the imputation mask, resulting in a unied model for various down-stream
  tasks including data generation and imputation. Evaluation on synthetic high-dimensional
  and challenging low-dimensional multimodal datasets shows improvement over the state-of-the-art
  imputation models. "
