title: " HM-VAEs: a Deep Generative Model for\r Real-valued Data with Heterogeneous
  Marginals"
abstract: "In this paper, we propose a very simple but e\r ective VAE model (HM-VAE)
  that can handle real-valued data with heterogeneous marginals, meaning that they
  have drastically distinct marginal distributions, statistical properties as well
  as semantics. Preliminary results show that the HM-VAE can learn distributions with
  heterogeneous marginal distributions, whereas the vanilla VAEs fails. "
