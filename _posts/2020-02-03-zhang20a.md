title: " Rapid Model Comparison by Amortizing Across Models"
abstract: " Comparing the inferences of diverse candidate models is an essential part
  of model checking and escaping local optima. To enable efficient comparison, we
  introduce an amortized variational inference framework that can perform fast and
  reliable posterior estimation across models of the same architecture. Our Any Parameter
  Encoder (APE) extends the encoder neural network common in amortized inference to
  take both a data feature vector and a model parameter vector as input. APE thus
  reduces posterior inference across unseen data and models to a single forward pass.
  In experiments comparing candidate topic models for synthetic data and product reviews,
  our Any Parameter Encoder yields comparable posteriors to more expensive methods
  in far less time, especially when the encoder architecture is designed in model-aware
  fashion."
