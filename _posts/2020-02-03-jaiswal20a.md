title: " Variational Bayesian Methods for Stochastically Constrained System Design
  Problems"
abstract: " We study system design problems stated as parameterized stochastic programs
  with a chance-constraint set. We adopt a Bayesian approach that requires the computation
  of a posterior predictive integral which is usually intractable. In addition, for
  the problem to be a well-dened convex program, we must retain the convexity of the
  feasible set. Consequently, we propose a variational Bayes-based method to approximately
  compute the posterior predictive integral that ensures tractability and retains
  the convexity of the feasible set. Under certain regularity conditions, we also
  show that the solution set obtained using variational Bayes converges to the true
  solution set as the number of observations tends to infinity. We also provide bounds
  on the probability of qualifying a true infeasible point (with respect to the true
  constraints) as feasible under the VB approximation for a given number of samples."
