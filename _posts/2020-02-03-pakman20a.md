title: 'Neural Permutation Processes '
abstract: " We introduce a neural architecture to perform amortized approximate Bayesian
  inference over latent random permutations of two sets of objects. The method involves
  approximating permanents of matrices of pairwise probabilities using recent ideas
  on functions dened over sets. Each sampled permutation comes with a probability
  estimate, a quantity unavailable in MCMC approaches. We illustrate the method in
  sets of 2D points and MNIST images."
