title: "MMD-Bayes: Robust Bayesian Estimation via Maximum\r Mean Discrepancy"
abstract: "In some misspeci\fed settings, the posterior distribution in Bayesian statistics
  may lead to inconsistent estimates. To x this issue, it has been suggested to replace
  the likelihood by a pseudo-likelihood, that is the exponential of a loss function
  enjoying suitable robustness properties. In this paper, we build a pseudo-likelihood
  based on the Maximum Mean\r Discrepancy, dened via an embedding of probability distributions
  into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We show that this MMD-Bayes posterior is
  consistent and robust to\r model misspecication. As the posterior obtained in this
  way might be intractable, we also prove that reasonable variational approximations
  of this posterior enjoy the same properties. We provide details on a stochastic
  gradient algorithm to compute these variational approximations. Numerical simulations
  indeed suggest that our estimator is more robust to misspecication than the ones
  based on the likelihood."
