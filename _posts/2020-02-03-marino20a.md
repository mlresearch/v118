title: " Improving Sequential Latent Variable Models\r with Autoregressive Flows"
abstract: We propose an approach for sequence modeling based on autoregressive normalizing
  ows. Each autoregressive transform, acting across time, serves as a moving reference
  frame for modeling higher-level dynamics. This technique provides a simple, general-purpose
  method for improving sequence modeling, with connections to existing and classical
  techniques. We demonstrate the proposed approach both with standalone models, as
  well as a part of larger sequential latent variable models. Results are presented
  on three benchmark video datasets, where ow-based dynamics improve log-likelihood
  performance over baseline models.
