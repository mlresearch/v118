title: 'GP-ALPS: Automatic Latent Process Selection for Multi-Output Gaussian Process
  Models '
abstract: " In this work, we apply Bayesian model selection to the calibration of
  the complexity of the latent space. We propose an extension of the LMM that automatically
  chooses the latent processes by turning off those that do not meaningfully contribute
  to explaining the data. We call the technique Gaussian Process Automatic Latent
  Process Selection (GPALPS). The extra functionality of GP-ALPS comes at the cost
  of exact inference, so we devise a variational inference (VI) scheme and demonstrate
  its suitability in a set of preliminary experiments. We also assess the quality
  of the variational posterior by comparing our approximate results with those obtained
  via a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach."
