title: 'Sinkhorn Permutation Variational Marginal Inference '
abstract: " We address the problem of marginal inference for an exponential family
  defined over the set of permutation matrices. This problem is known to quickly become
  intractable as the size of the permutation increases, since its involves the computation
  of the permanent of a matrix, a #P-hard problem. We introduce Sinkhorn variational
  marginal inference as a scalable alternative, a method whose validity is ultimately
  justified by the so-called Sinkhorn approximation of the permanent. We demonstrate
  the effectiveness of our method in the problem of probabilistic identification of
  neurons in the worm C.elegans."
