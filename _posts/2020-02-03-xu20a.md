title: "AdvancedHMC.jl: A robust, modular and efficient implementation of advanced
  HMC algorithms "
abstract: "Stan’s Hamilton Monte Carlo (HMC) has demonstrated remarkable sampling
  robustness and efficiency in a wide range of Bayesian inference problems through
  carefully crafted adaption schemes to the celebrated No-U-Turn sampler (NUTS) algorithm.
  It is challenging to implement these adaption schemes robustly in practice, hindering
  wider adoption amongst practitioners who are not directly working with the Stan
  modelling language. AdvancedHMC.jl (AHMC) contributes a modular, well-tested,
  standalone implementation of NUTS that recovers and extends Stan’s NUTS algorithm.
  AHMC is written in Julia, a modern high-level language for scientic computing, benefoting
  from optional hardware acceleration and interoperability with a wealth of existing
  software written in both Julia and other languages, such as Python. Efficacy is
  demonstrated empirically by comparison with Stan through a third-party Markov chain
  Monte Carlo benchmarking suite."
