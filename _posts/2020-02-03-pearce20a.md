title: " The Gaussian Process Prior VAE for\r Interpretable Latent Dynamics from Pixels"
abstract: " We consider the problem of unsupervised learning of a low dimensional,
  interpretable, latent state of a video containing a moving object. The problem of
  distilling interpretable dynamics from pixels has been extensively considered through
  the lens of graphical/state space models (Fraccaro et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018;
  Pearce et al., 2018; Chiappa and Paquet, 2019) that exploit Markov structure for
  cheap computation and structured priors for enforcing interpretability on latent
  representations. We take a step towards extending these approaches by discarding
  the Markov structure; inspired by Gaussian process dynamical models (Wang et al.,
  2006), we instead repurpose the recently proposed Gaussian Process Prior Variational
  Autoencoder (Casale et al., 2018) for learning interpretable latent dynamics. We
  describe the model and perform experiments on a synthetic dataset and see that the
  model reliably reconstructs smooth dynamics exhibiting U-turns and loops. We also
  observe that this model may be trained without any  annealing or freeze-thaw of
  training parameters in contrast to previous works, albeit for slightly dierent use
  cases, where application specic training tricks are often required."
