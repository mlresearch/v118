title: " Pseudo-Bayesian Learning via Direct Loss Minimization with Applications to
  Sparse Gaussian Process Models"
abstract: 'We propose that approximate Bayesian algorithms should optimize a new criterion,
  directly derived from the loss, to calculate their approximate posterior which we
  refer to as pseudo-posterior. Unlike standard variational inference which optimizes
  a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood, the new algorithms can be analyzed
  to provide loss guarantees on the predictions with the pseudo-posterior. Our criterion
  can be used to derive new sparse Gaussian process algorithms that have error guarantees
  applicable to various likelihoods. '
