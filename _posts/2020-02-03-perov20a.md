title: 'MultiVerse: Causal Reasoning using Importance Sampling in Probabilistic Programming '
abstract: " We elaborate on using importance sampling for causal reasoning, in particular
  for counterfactual inference. We show how this can be implemented natively in probabilistic
  programming. By considering the structure of the counterfactual query, one can signicantly
  optimise the inference process. We also consider design choices to enable further
  optimisations. We introduce MultiVerse, a probabilistic programming prototype engine
  for approximate causal reasoning. We provide experimental results and compare with
  Pyro, an existing probabilistic programming framework with some of causal reasoning
  tools."
