title: 'Information in Infinite Ensembles of Infinitely-Wide Neural Networks '
abstract: " In this preliminary work, we study the generalization properties of in
  nite ensembles of in nitely-wide neural networks. Amazingly, this model family admits
  tractable calculations for many information-theoretic quantities. We report analytical
  and empirical investigations in the search for signals that correlate with generalization."
